Here is a [Demo][1]

This can be run as a widget or a full page application

To run as a widget on your webpage add
```html
<div class="rollContain" style='width: 500px; height: 500px'></div>
<script type='module' src="https://jleritte.github.io/roller/js/Roller.js"></script>
```

The div is to tell the widget where you insert itself. Without that div it will assume you want it to have global access. In the global access mode it will attach event handlers to the window to listen for keys inputs.
